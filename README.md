# A♯
The BASIC programming language with a few fixes and additions. This is meant to be an educational project that I might expand on.
## How to use
```BASIC
1. Double-Click interpreter.py
2. Code!
```
Refer to [The BASIC manual](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/phaseOneSystems/oasis/BASIC_Language_Reference_Manual_Mar80.pdf) If you actually want to code something.
